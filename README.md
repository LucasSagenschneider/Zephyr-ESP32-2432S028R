# Zephyr-ESP32-2432S028R

This project should serve as a starting point for the ESP32-2432S028R circuit board. 
(also known as the cheap yellow display)
I plan to configure Zephyr for this board.

The setup will first follow the examples from Shawn.
I would also like to give a big thanks to him. he has built a great tutorial on Youtube.
